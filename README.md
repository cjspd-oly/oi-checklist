## Local Development Instructions

> Requires Python 3 and Node.js installed locally.

1. Install all Python dependencies from:
   ```
   backend/requirements.txt
   ```

2. Initialize the database:
   ```bash
   python backend/init_db.py
   ```

3. Populate problems:
   ```bash
   python populate_problems.py
   ```

4. Start the Flask backend:
   ```bash
   python backend/app.py
   ```

5. Use a tool like Live Server to launch the frontend from the root directory (where `index.html` lives).

> 💡 Make sure to update the `apiUrl` in `config.js` to match your Flask server’s URL.

Once setup is complete, you can use the `checklist.sh` script to start both frontend and backend together. Modify directory paths inside it as needed.
